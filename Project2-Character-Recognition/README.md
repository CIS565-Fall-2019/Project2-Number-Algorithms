# README

Sadly this is all that runs so far; I will update if I decide to take a late day!

For my readme, I think I would not be able to make graphs analysing framerate to image size, as it doesn't seem we were provided varying sizes, but I would recode the hard-coded perceptron to get data for the other two graphs.

I would start with the perceptron classifier to match training input data to output data by adaptively learning.

Then running it on all the data, hopefully converging onto Hannah's excel data
