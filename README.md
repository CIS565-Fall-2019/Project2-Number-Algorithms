# README - Stream Compaction and Neural Networks

Links to the readmes of the two subprojects:

[Part 1: Stream Compaction](Project2-Stream-Compaction/README.md)

[Part 2: Character Recognition](Project2-Character-Recognition/README.md)

In both, I changed the CMake files to match my computer architecture.
