See these readmes for more information on the two subprojects:

* [Stream Compaction](./Project2-Stream-Compaction/README.md)
* [Character Recognition](./Project2-Character-Recognition/README.md) 

Note: changed the sm value in CMakeLists of both stream_compaction and character_recognition to higher value so the project would build.
